        Sendbypass is an innovative online platform that facilitates the
        carriage of cargo by connecting senders with air travelers. Within the
        Sendbypass framework, the individual requesting the carriage of cargo,
        referred to as the “Requester”, may either be a third party sending
        cargo to a receiver or the intended receiver themselves.
        <br />
        Sendbypass does not participate in the actual act of transportation.
        Instead, it functions solely as an intermediary between the Requester
        and the air traveler to match them together. For this, Sendbypass
        facilitates connections by maintaining a registry of senders and
        travelers, enabling them to match and coordinate directly. For the
        avoidance of doubt, Sendbypass neither carries nor transports cargo, nor
        does it arrange for the transportation of cargo. The responsibility for
        transportation rests entirely with the traveler.
        <br />
        Sendbypass provides a secure platform for senders and travelers to
        connect, establish and regulate their relationships, and document the
        handover and delivery of items with clarity and precision.
        <br />
        The platform’s unique features enhance transparency and security,
        fostering trust and efficiency in the delivery process.

      "Evidentiary support in case of disputes and legal clarity through transparency",

    content: (
      <p className="text-body-large text-on-surface">
        To ensure transparency, the platform uses verification codes to track
        and record delivery progress throughout the trip. This allows the
        Requester to access real-time updates on their cargo’s status.
        <br />
        Additionally, the platform supports the upload of cargo images during
        the delivery process. This functionality allows all parties involved to
        document evidence with a neutral third party (Sendbypass), which can
        serve as a reliable reference in case of disputes.
        <br />
        By these, the platform fosters transparency by maintaining a clear and
        detailed record of every transaction, including timelines, cargo
        details, and agreements between parties. This clarity helps prevent
        misunderstandings and creates a solid foundation for legal compliance in
        case of unforeseen disputes or claims.

        Sendbypass provides a mechanism to document and verify the cargo being
        transported, which helps travelers protect themselves from potential
        liabilities, such as claims of transporting prohibited or illegal items.
        This legal safeguard offers peace of mind to travelers, mitigating risks
        that could arise during international or domestic transportation.
        <br />
        In this respect, Sendbypass meticulously structures the legal
        relationships among its users. While the platform charges fees for its
        intermediary services in facilitating connections, the legal
        relationship between the Requester and the traveler is formalized and
        safeguarded through a Delivery Service Agreement. This agreement,
        executed between Sendbypass, the Requester, and the traveler, clearly
        defines the roles and responsibilities of each party and addresses the
        potential risks and liabilities that may arise under various scenarios
        during the shipment process.

      <p className="text-body-large text-on-surface">
        While the risk of unauthorised cargo can arise in any scenario,
        Sendbypass offers an added layer of protection for travelers. The
        platform can provide users with guidance or resources on specific legal
        requirements in different jurisdictions (e.g., customs rules, prohibited
        items, and taxation issues). By helping users comply with these
        requirements, Sendbypass reduces the likelihood of fines, penalties, or
        legal challenges arising from non-compliance
        <br />
        Additionally, the platform helps create a presumption in favor of the
        traveler, demonstrating that any illegal item does not belong to them.
        In such cases, liability for unauthorised items rests with the
        Requester, offering travelers an added sense of security. Ultimately,
        the decision to carry cargo remains at the traveler’s sole discretion.
        Travelers are strongly advised to exercise caution.
        <br />
        To support the users, Sendbypass provides educational resources on its
        website, helping travelers verify items and consult customs regulations
        for the destination country before accepting any cargo.
